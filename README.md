# Digit-Recognition
# HandWritten Digit Recognition Using Machine Learning in Python

In this project, i have used three Machine Learning Data Clasification Algorithms 
-> Support Vector Machine.
-> Neural Networks.
-> Convolution Neural Network.

Accuracy -> SVM < NN < CNN

I had maximum accuracy of 99.7% using CNN on 9th epoch.
